# GameBot 
### for Warhammer 40000 Lost Crusade - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orcacorp.wargame)
Your personal assistant for repetitive tasks including:
* Resource collection
* Join Breach Assault (in game event)
* Help other alliance members
* Claim drops from Landing Pad
* Request army production
* Restart crashed game application

## Tech

Bot uses following libraries:
- [pypiwin32](https://pypi.org/project/pypiwin32/) - windows handling, mouse cursor move, clicks
- [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/) - sound notifications
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) [image](https://pypi.org/project/image/) [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - image recognition


## How it works

GameBot has two main parts. libBot.py is a toolkit handling all technical stuff like mouse control, window control or image recognition. On top of that, LostCrusade.py has the game logic with all steps required to perform in-game tasks like send army to gather resources or order production of new units.

On technical level, modus operandi is to check on screen, using image recognition, if there is particular button/symbol, click it and check results - for example another button/symbol appeared on screen, then proceed with next step. 

## Installation

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

OR

```pip install pypiwin32 playsound Image numpy opencv-python```

## Configuration


```python
def mainLoop():
    ...
    #enabled routines:
    crashedApp()
    gatherResources()
    if findImgOnScreen(screenOpts, 'res\\armyList2.png') != 0:
        clickGame(screenOpts, clicks.events, 1)
    joinBreach()
    helpFlag()
    helpFlag()
    dropship()
    trainArmy()
    ...
```

mainLoop() contains tasks for GameBot to execute, they can be disabled by commenting out unneeded routines

## Launch

```python LostCrusade.py```


## Demo how it works

### Example for Gather Resources. 
* Click ARMY button (1)
![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toleksa/GameBot/main/doc/1.png)

* Check if there is free army slot:

* Found free slot, so next step is to look for resources (2)

* Choose resource type (3) - by default it goes by round robin for all four types and can be adjusted in nextRSS()

* Check if there is collect icon and click it (5)

* Deploy army (6)

* Army is traveling to resource deposit for gathering - success

* Yes, I skipped step (4) ;)

### Example for Landing Pad:
* Locate dropship icon and click it
![9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toleksa/GameBot/main/doc/9.png)

* If there is CLAIM button, get reward
![10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toleksa/GameBot/main/doc/10.png)

* Otherwise CLOSE window and come back later - in this example CLOSE button is on same place as CLAIM, but sometimes it's X in corner, this situation is also handled by bot.
